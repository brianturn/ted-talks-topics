# Uncovering the most common TED Talk topics

## Summary

If you were tasked with presenting a prestigious TED Talk, what would you talk about?

For this natural language processing project, I examined patterns and topics common to TED Talks. In a somewhat tongue-and-cheek response, I presented my findings as “the 25 most common topics to avoid -- if you want to be original.”

After scraping 2300 TED Talk transcripts using BeautifulSoup, I compared topic modelling techniques using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). 

I completed this project while attending Metis, a full-time, data science bootcamp.
